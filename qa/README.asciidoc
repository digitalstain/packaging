Neo4j Server QA
===============

These QA tests exercise the server from a user perspective, consuming and
exercising the publicly available artifacts. The QA tests are broken into
indivdual "features" written using Cucumber BDD. Look in the `features`
subdirectory to see all the tests.

Requirements
------------

Full Ruby development environment:

* ruby 1.8.7+
* rubygems 
* rvm (recommended, but optional)

Gems:

* cucumber - for running QA tests

With maven (first time):

  `mvn -Dcucumber.installGems=true integration-test`
